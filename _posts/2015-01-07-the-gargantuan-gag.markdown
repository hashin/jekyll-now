Once in a while you feel that you simply don't exist. You are so much stupefied by the grand scheme of things that you look at the matter that makes you up and holds all those molecules that defines what you are actually.

You are nothing but a random configuration of organic shit that tries to run away from equilibrium. You are the hamster running up the y = &mu;x with zero &mu;. And the equilibrium lies in the origin.

All this just shows that I am alive and you are yet to attend my funeral.
