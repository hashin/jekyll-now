title: What has been your biggest achievement so far and why do you consider it to
  be so?
---

My biggest achievement till date is a logical and scientifically trained mind. I have had moments of notable individual feats in my life, but I consider them as mere consequences of the way I had trained my mind to think straight.

I believe that a coherent mind and the ability to think straight was not a gift that I received. I had put in years of effort to look at the world the way I am looking at it now. In the process of growing up, I had to imbibe lots of dogma and adopt a skewed world view distorted by religion and the socio-economic conditions of my surroundings.

But slowly, I found science and realised that it offers the best world view possible. Science may not be right always, but it tries to look at things objectively and come up with the most plausible conclusion. 

I consider this as my biggest achievement because it has helped me find peace in the uncertainty of this world. This gives me happiness and for me, the entire purpose of human existence is the ability to find happiness. I subscribe to the wisdom of Ren√© Descartes here - "I think, therefore I am."
