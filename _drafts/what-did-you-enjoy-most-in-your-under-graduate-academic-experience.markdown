title: What did you enjoy most in your under graduate academic experience?
---


The course completing project a.k.a the Major Project.

Our institute places originality in research with high regards when it comes to graduate education. Students were highly encouraged to take up original research for the major project and submit their results however small that may be. If was OK even if we didn't have major results, but tried earnestly to solve the open problem at hand.

I enjoyed working on a relatively new field of Wireless Sensor Networks and created an adhoc solution for a specific implementation challenge. What I loved about the project was the support we received from our teachers in taking up an open problem and creating small solutions rather than generating complex solutions for already solved problems. That was a refreshing experience as a student and I learned a lot in the process.
