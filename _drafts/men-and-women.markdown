title: Alpha and Beta.

The torture lasted for a fortnight and several hours well into the midnight before I could regain my consciousness.

I found myself stranded at the shores of a gargantuan swimming pool somewhere near the outskirts of our galaxy. There was truckloads of mucus blocking my trachea. A bout of virulent sneezing descended upon me. 

Half a pound sand, an ounce of *Trichoderma* boiled with *Saccharomyces Cerevisiae* and blended in one shot whiskey; I was ready to face the world again.

I pulled myself ashore and started humming a song that was starting to dwindle away from my memory. And that's when I noticed a patch of luminescence swimming towards my isle.

My innards were twitching at the sense of imminent danger. Before I could make a move, it emerged out of water and stood in front of me within split second. I looked at it's eyes and what I saw would stay with me for a lifetime.

Her eyes were the blackest black box you would ever see. Much like a black hole, whatever that went inside was gone forever. I could see all the five dimensions along with my horoscope in her eyes. 

He started to tell the stories untold. With a creak in the space-time, I fell into another world where the I couldn't speak my tongue anymore.

Story telling was his forte, I chose to keep quiet and tuned my ears to whatever he had to say...

Far away, in the land of *Monsoniacs*, there are two divisions to the mankind. If you travel further west to the hills of *Tansiachs*, it's mankind split into four; further west at the isles of *Chipprakthiaks*, you get eight pieces of mankind.

Farther west and further dimensions later, you would discover the fault lines increasing as in a geometric progression. I am not surprised to see it incomprehensible to the 3D humans; I will continue with the story nevertheless.

The two kinds of humans among the monsoniacs, we named them Alpha and Beta. And I am going to tell their story. A story of life and death. The bible for generations to come and feed upon.

But alas, I can't write down both the stories because there is only one story. Only one species is historically recorded.

For the early days of civilisation, only one species was entitled for education. You have to an Alpha if you are to go out of home and study.
