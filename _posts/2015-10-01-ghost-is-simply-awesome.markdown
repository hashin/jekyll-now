I recently updated to Ghost 0.6.4 on Openshift. I am currently on the honeymoon period and enjoying the product well. A big thanks to [Kiko Beats](https://github.com/Kikobeats) for providing an amazing theme on which I could build on.

The version I was using was old and lacked almost all the good features that the new Ghost has to offer. Now, writing from the new Ghost dashboard, I can see Ghost evolving into a full-fledged blogging platform.

It's a pleasure to write on the uncluttered writing pane. The colour schemes have been improved and I feel home once again using the Ghost.

The experience is markedly different from my painful experience of running a Wordpress blog. 

I am looking forward to writing more from this world I am in constant touch with my Ghost. 

And I am once again throwing [my promise](http://blog.hashin.me/2014/10/04/the-joy-of-writing/) of giving a free walkthrough for anyone interested in creating a Ghost blog on a custom domain.

Looking forward to write and help people write!
