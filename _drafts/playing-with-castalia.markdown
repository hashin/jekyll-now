Castalia was a nymph of whom Apollo consecrated by converting her into a fountain that will produce sacred water and a mesmerizing sound for generations of intellectuals and poets. Even after her transition, Castalia has managed to stay as an inspiration for men to achieve more in their life. Even if you can't get her, you could draw water from her and listen to her sweet voice whilst the water percolates through her intricacies. 

The thing that made me think about Castalia is the fact that I am playing with this great piece of software called Castalia that has been written to simulate the physical layer of a wireless network. It comes with a lot of options to model the channel and the radio modules that we will be using. 

I don't know if I am particularly interesting in doing some research in the wireless medium modelling, but I find this pretty interesting. The code is well written and the scripts are really readable and easy to use. I have done some modelling of the popular Xbee modules and is hopeful that the simulation results are somewhat indicative of what we might get in the test bed.

I know that it is foolish to expect great accuracy from simulations of this sort, but deep inside me there is someone saying why I must trust this software. Partly because I like something about it. May be the greek mythology part has rendered an image so infallible that I can't help but adore this software. A nice job indeed by the people who created it. 

If you are making a product like this, don't forget to give it a name like this that will make them like your product unconsciously. And also, don't forget to build a great product.
