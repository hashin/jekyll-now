We, the people of the world are much more related to each other than we want ourselves to believe. 

Once cannot learn enough languages and travel to enough places to state this 'connection' conclusively. I just want to write a short note about one interesting thing that I came across today.

I was reading about the Islamic Golden age and came across the inimitable [Avicenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna). One thing caught my attention. He was born in Bukhara in present day Uzbekistan to a lady named SitƒÅra. (Pronounced *'Sitaara'*).

If you are from India, you know that Sitara is a common name here, meaning "The morning star". I was amazed about this connected and tried to look up what it means in Uzbek language.
