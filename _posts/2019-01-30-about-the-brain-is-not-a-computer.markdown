I found [this excellent article](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) on Aeon.

It is highly recommended for anyone who is interested in the subject of neuroscience and philosophy. As disparate these subjects might be, there is a necessary connection. Finding this connection is crucial in deciphering the most fundamental questions regarding both the subjects - what is the purpose of these disciplines. Perhaps more importantly, where will these disciplines take us as a species?

We live in a world where doing science is as normal as it can get. Sure, lot of people have reservations about extending scientific insights into their private lives - especially the religious sphere. At the same time, it doesn't desist us from indulging in the comforts that scienfitic progress brings in. This dichotomy is not something I wish to resolve. My concerns here are about the way abstractions can influence the concrete outputs of research.

One key takeaway from the article is the way this model has aspired our perception of the future. Such things like 'Brain supercomputers' and 'Brain machine direct links' doesn't render readily under the current understanding about the Human brain. However, by resorting to this archaic abstraction, investors are readily convinced about the possibility. While genuine scientific and technological progress could flow out of these endeavours, I am quite concerned about the duplicity (perhaps unintended) involved in the whole process.

Leaving that aside, the cognitive baggage such a model brings into philosophy is immense. While many philosophers doesn't burden themselves with the physical limitation of Human brain, doing so has many real advantages. It adds a new dimension to our thinking process and limits the scope of mystic manoeuvres. Also, such things as letting go of the concept of memory as a 'retrieving mechanism' also brings in profound insights. The chemical storage system of brain makes sense on the temporal domain as well. That is, if we are to remove a certain brain state from the time frame where it is operating, it doesn't make much sense!

So even if we faithfully emulate the bio-chemical system as well as state of Human brain in some physical system, it doesn't give us much information without a time series accompanying it. So without the life history of a person, including her chemical signature, we cannot 'read' a brain per se. There is one more consideration that we should take here.

Our channels of information acquisition are incredibly noisy and lossy. Our eyes are evolved to pick up only those things we need to see. The ears too, like cutting out information when you are thinking deep. Even the nose shuttles more information while cooking and eating than otherwise. So there is a real bias in admitting information. On the top of it, the brain 'takes in' only part of this information for 'storage'. The article demonstrates this fact through the dollar bill experiment. Think about this - most of us can recognise a dollar bill even if we see only a tip of it sticking out of a book. This adds a contextual dimension to the memory. What we know as dollar bills are spread across our idea of currency, different denominations, concept of money as a medium of exchange and the general idea of its design. This allows us to make sense of a Nigerian naira,
