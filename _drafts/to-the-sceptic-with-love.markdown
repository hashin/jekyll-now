Here is the deal - I am going to curate whatever stuff I can amass about free thought so as to benefit the *initiated and self-motivated* person who wants to form an opinion on this universe and it's origin.

But why I am doing it?

Today (22nd June, 2016) I feel nostalgic about the days I spent at 301, Mega hostel, NIT Calicut trying to learn and understand as much as I can about the universe and form a learned opinion about how this universe work and how I should look at it.

Sure, I had opinions before. I was not certain about them. I am not entirely certain about my opinions even today. I have learned that opinions doesn't matter.

I am fascinated by the amount of raw truth in Rene Descartes words about the process of thinking.

I think, Therefore I am. I even wrote [an article](https://medium.hashin.me/i-think-therefore-i-am-a2c4a9f7f607#.abfy6p7bv " target="_blank) about it!

This is more about how to think and how you form an opinion on topics like god, religion, dogma among other stuff. Probably these thinking skills will help you in other fronts of life as well.

You can keep reading them here in **no particular order** or check out [my story](#story).

<h4 id="story"> The Story.</h4> 
The story is that I spent an entire semester reading over Internet. I skipped as many classes I can, did minimal course work and did nothing other than reading over Internet..

I skimmed through thousands of Wikipedia articles, pieces at [brainpickings](http://www.brainpickings.org) and [lesswrong](http://lesswrong.com) among innumerous other sites and spend hours reading [Quora](http://www.quora.com).


Quora was an amazing platform back then with a lot of people contributing to the topics that really mattered. It was relatively free of propaganda and other bullshit.

What make me so nostalgic is the lengths I went so that I can maximise the efficacy of my learning process. There was no wired internet available at [Mega Hostel](http://www.nitc.ac.in/index.php/?url=content/index/3462/2/2686/168) and I had to depend entirely upon an MTS dongle for wireless internet. 

As a cash stripped college student with no real source of income other than from my parents, the only plan I could afford was the "1 GB for INR 249 per month" plan.

To make sure that I was squeezing it to the last byte, I switched my OS from Windows to Fedora, learnt about linux so that I can restrict background data usage, block image content in sites and could load images only when I needed to see them. 

All of these looks so easy now, but for that guy who didn't know how to program or how linux works, those were the heydays when I would give a pat or two to myself for being able to do all those.

In short, I ended up consuming almost 1 GB worth information in text every month. I can only imagine the hours and hours I slogged in front of the system to learn as much as I can.

Sure I won't be able to recollect everything I read, but I am sure those articles by wise men and women shaped my opinion and made me what I am. As part of giving back, I will create this curated list for anyone who wishes to start a fresh and look at the world with a clean mind.
