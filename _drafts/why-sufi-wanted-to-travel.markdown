> Sufiya was a few years shy of being double my age when I met her. 

I wish I could relive that day I met Sufiya. It was all a mess in Calcutta. It was raining and it was hot. The sewers were 

I was about to leave after living for around two months in the city of joy. I couldn't really comprehend why it was still called the city of joy. I can't really blame anyone because I largely confined my stay in and around Park Circus, where people bathed, ate, slept and procreated in the footpaths so that they became open books from which we could learn what life is all about.

People do recognise that our lives are the sum total of our decisions. But they seldom give life to the thought that each and ever decision that we take, for instance choosing to eat from a particular eating joint ends up changing us in ways we don't really understand.

It was raining cats and dogs. But it was all hot and tiny arteries in my forehead was pulsating, as if warning me about an impending flu stretch. But I couldn't afford to cosy up in my room since my grand parents are arriving in the city and I have to take them around for some days before we would set out to explore the east coast of India.

My grandfather believed that the fantastic story of his ancestors begin from the land of Visakhapatnam (Vizag). My mind was buzzing with calculations. I had a vague plan on what to do inside the city. After that, may be a couple of days in Puri. Temples, chilka lake and some Bhubaneshwar before we left to Vizag. 

I would take them to Victoria Memorial first. Seemed like a good plan.
