This is my first job after college. I believe in the motto -  "whatever that doesn't kill you makes you stronger". All the challenges I faced have made me a better individual and will continue to do so.

I have faced technical as well as non-technical challenges at this role. Technical challenges had more to do with the nature of platform I am working with. Scarce resources and the need to meet deadlines was pulling me down at the beginning. But I have adapted well with time and now I find myself enjoy working on this product. And the fact that my product is ultimately going to change the lives of millions of people is indeed rewarding.

Non-technical challenges arose from the way things are arranged in a corporate environment. I faced issues in communicating concisely and reliably. But I could pick it up in a short period of time and right now, I can communicate better and save a lot of time,energy and resources. 

My experience here encouraged me to learn more and come up with better ways for people to communicate and coordinate at the workplace. Productivity Management has emerged as an area of active interest for me.
