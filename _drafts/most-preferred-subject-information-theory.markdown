title: Why YIF?
---

I believe that Young India scholarship will equip me with a world view necessary to work with people from different backgrounds and cultures. My experience with traditional education systems are unforthcoming. Moreover, it has corrupted my natural learning ability and evolution as a creator. I am willing to unlearn the wrong elements if necessary to cultivate myself into a better human being with a much better understanding of the core problems that we as a species face.

I find myself committed to the greater good of humanity and believe that my intellect is well utilised if it is put on the right task of making this planet a better place to live in. Understanding different disciplines that have contributed to the human progress is inevitable for innovation in the coming decades.

In this era when technology and methodology is racing fast towards the limits, I strongly believe that mating of the ideas from different disciplines of human achievement will be quintessential to any system focusing on innovation driven growth. I am looking forward to YIF as a learner as well as an enabler to learning.
