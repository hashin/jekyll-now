Research says only 40% of all the men who have walked on this planet have reproduced while 80% of the women gave birth to at least one offspring.

Patriarchy was not an act of terrorism, it was a desperate attempt to bring in order. It wasn't a good thing to do, but think about the millions of men who died in loneliness. :/


This is not an attempt to eulogize patriarchy, but an attempt to throw some light to it's roots so that we are more considerate while dealing with this mess. We should get our facts right.
