I have searched spirituality in the hundreds of man hours spend much before I was born.

They offer peace, but not speak of life.

They discuss faith, but forget love.

They talk about Justice and do not mention revelation.

Post Tenebras Lux.

I close the book and kiss his photo. Paulo Coelhoï»¿ has once again take me to the dark corners of the universe, where we talk about the most mundane and mourn for the most profane. 'Adultery' is something to which everyone should commit.
