I am giving a talk about the Internet of Things for the Barcamp Bangalore Monsoon 2015 session.

Please mark your attendance at the link below.

This page will act as the road map and resource compilation for the talk. I will update it as soon as a new topic is added to the talk.

Let's see how the research turns out to be ;)

1. A Wired article as a starting point. [(here)](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/)

2. The article on The internet of things website - What is IoT?. [(here)](http://www.theinternetofthings.eu/what-is-the-internet-of-things)
