This song written my Sahir Ludhiyanvi and sung by Mohammed Rafi is an ode to a spirit that is alive since the dawn of civilization. It is the enduring conflict between a rebel poet who finds society unacceptable while the society shorns the poet with no mercy. Now, it is impossible to take an normative stand on this issue. Perhaps, the society is too bigoted to accept the radical poet. Or, the poet is too delusional to try imposing his lofty ideals of a society that is struggling to barely survive.

Whatever the case may be, It is worth listening to the lamentations of a broken poet. Someone who is broken not only by the insidious forces of society, but also by his love, his loss and the spirit of living that he lost somewhere down the line.

### English Translation of lyrics:

Yeh mahlo.n yeh takhto.n yeh taajo.n ki duniya,

THIS IS A WORLD OF PALACES, THROMES AND CROWNS...

Yeh insaa.n ke dushman samaajo.n ki duniya,

THIS IS A WORLD OF PACKS OF ENEMIES OF MANKIND...

Yeh mahlo.n yeh takhto.n yeh taajo.n ki duniya,

THIS IS A WORLD OF PALACES, THROMES AND CROWNS...

Yeh insaa.n ke dushman, samaajo.n ki duniya,

THIS IS A WORLD OF PACKS OF ENEMIES OF MANKIND...

Yeh daulat ke bhooke, rivaajo.n ki duniya,

THIS IS A WORLD OF WEALTH GRUBBING MORES...

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai,

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye, toh kya hai.

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?


Har ik jism ghaayal,

EACH AND EVERY BODY IS IN PAIN..

Har ik rooh pyaasi,

EACH AND EVERY SOUL IS THIRSTY...

Nigaahon mein uljhan

CONFUSION IN EYES,

Dilo.n mein udaasi,

SORROW IN THE HEART,

Yeh duniya hai ya aalam-e-bad-hawaasi,

IS THIS THE WORLD OR OR A CRAZY PLACE?

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai,

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai.

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?


Jahaa.n ek khilona hai insaan ki hasti,

WHERE MAN’S PERSONALITY (STATUS) IS A PLAYTHING,

Yeh basti hai murda-parasto.n ki basti,

THIS DWELLING IS ONE OF WORSHIPPERS OF THE DEAD,

Yahaa.n par to jeevan se hai maut sasti,

HERE DEATH COMES CHEAPER THAN LIFE,

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai,

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai.

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?


Jawaani bhatakti hai badkaar ban kar,

YOUTH ROAMS ABOUT IN LEWDNESS,

Jawaa.n jism sajte hain bazaar ban kar,

YOUNG BODIES ARE DISPLAYED LIKE CHATTELS,

Jahaa.n pyaar hota hai vyopaar ban kar,

WHERE LOVE IS MADE INTO A BUSINESS,

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai,

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai.

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?


Yeh duniya jahaa.n aadmi kuchh nahin hai

THIS WORLD WHERE MAN IS NOTHING,

Wafa kuchh nahin dosti kuchh nahin hai,

TRUST IS NOTHING, FRIENDSHIP IS NOTHING,

Yeh duniya jahaa.n, aadmi kuchh nahin hai,

THIS WORLD WHERE MAN IS NOTHING,

Wafa kuchh nahin dosti kuchh nahin hai,

TRUST IS NOTHING, FRIENDSHIP IS NOTHING,

Jahaa.n pyaar ki qadr hee kuchh nahin hai,

WHERE LOVE'S VALUE ITSELF IS NOTHING,

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai,

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai.

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?


Jalaa doh, ise phoonk daalo yeh duniya,

BURN IT DOWN, BLOW AWAY THIS UNIVERSE!

Jalaa doh Jalaa doh Jalaa doh, ise phoonk daalo yeh duniya

BURN IT DOWN, BURN IT DOWN, BURN IT DOWN, AND BLOW AWAY THIS UNIVERSE!

Mere saamne se hataa lo yeh duniya,

REMOVE THIS WORLD FROM MY FACE,

Tumhaari hai tum hee, sambhaalo yeh duniya,

‘TIS YOURS, AND YOURS THE WORLD TO KEEP,

Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai.

WHAT IS IT, EVEN IF YOU WIN THIS UNIVERSE?
