I am an avid reader and I write a lot about the problems around me. I believe that the problems of our nation could be solved by promoting education and scientific thinking in the next generation.

This I believe, can be achieved by redesigning our curricula so that the student is exposed to the basics of science as well as art education at primary schooling level. Our understandings from various fields be combined so that a meaningful understanding is achieved by the student before he chooses the best field for himself. I strive to work in towards this goal.

At YIF, I am looking forward to meet people from various fields to compliment my understanding of sciences and arts. I am confident that I can contribute to YIF by working with people to create a more  general framework for understanding different subjects with logic as the most fundamental building block.
