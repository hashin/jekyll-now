I can safely say that if you don't fear Capitalism, you don't really *understand* it.

Now, before you jump into branding me with those crazy commie stereotypes, let me tell you that I am averse to that side of the spectrum too. But before going there, in an historic perspective, I would throw some light into what we don't normally talk about Capitalism.

Nehruvian Socialism is the butt for all the jokes lately. If you ask a twenty something, (s)he would blame it for everything bad that happened on the country. From the failure of Apollo 13 to the extinction of dinosaurs.

But we do know that it was a failed policy. What made him so averse to anything that was capitalist? He was so vocal about this so that even the prominent industrial houses and lobbying groups of the day identified themselves as committed to the socialist cause!

What was it that drove the sceptic that was Nehru away from Capitalism? Why did he opted for a closed market in the fledgling country when most of his counterparts in the South East Asia, chose an open economy?

And is it any manner related to part IV of our constitution - "Directive Principles of State Policy"?

But to answer that question, we need to go back in time for some 400 years. To the cold winter day that marked the end of the year 1600. 

It was on that day did Queen Elizabeth I sign a royal charter that gave East India Company (EIC) the exclusive right to trade in the east of Cape Good Hope.

Now this might look like a story that you already know. The ones you studied in schools. How merchants became rulers. We all know that EIC eventually went on to rule India. 

But what we miss is the complex socio-economico-political interaction that went behind the process. And that story, is in fact the story of modern Capitalism.

When formed, the English government didn't exert any control over the Company. It's shares were held by merchants and the aristocrats of the country. The government and the general public didn't pay much attention in the company as well.
