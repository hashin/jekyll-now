title: Most preferred Subject and why?
---

Information Theory and Coding. Despite being highly analytical, the subject offered me a cool abstract understanding of the way information is transmitted in today's communication systems. The subject helped me connect various scientific disciplines from fields  theory in abstract mathematics to why sexual reproduction is the most preferred mode of reproduction in biological world.

While learning coding theory, I was convinced of how human understanding can beat nature's limits and enable error free communication despite the noise and other deterrents. This subject reinforced my faith in science and motivated me to adopt a more scientific world view.
