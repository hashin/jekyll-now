I write about the world!

`A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle.  
~ P.G Wodehouse.`

I am into books, travel, debates and a bit of tech. I write about a lot of irrelevant stuff, though I am convinced of their utility when I write them. Sort of an existentialist, but I don't concur with the idea that existence is pain. Purpose of existence may be void, but we sure can infuse meaning by actively seeking self determination.  

I like good conversations and intelligent, self-aware people actively searching for something in life. Come see me someday!

Btw, if you want to give me some little publicity, this link can come handy - <a href="http://haveyoumethash.in" target="_blank">Have you met Hashin? </a>.
