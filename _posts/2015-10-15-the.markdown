Tinder is cruel.<br>
But so is life. Each one of us trying to paint it in the most beautiful of colors. To dab it with the most exquisite filters one can imagine.<br>
To extricate our lives of the material indulgences and to trim it into more presentable 'cards'. <br>
Only to be swiped off by some unassuming individual who will never grasp the length and breadth of the phenomenon that you are. <br>
Even if someone decides to stay, how many of them know what you truly are? <br>
None. <br>
Life is serendipity to some, contrived connivance to some and an impulsive mash up to some. <br>
I really can't estimate the depth of the cup I am drinking from. But I do know that the taste depends on the way I perceive it. So I keep on drinking.
