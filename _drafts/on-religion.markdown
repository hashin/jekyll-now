title: On the futility of religion.
---

Let's put it this way. Ask this one simple question to yourselves - Why is that there are good and bad people in all religions? 

It does appear childish, but let's do this one more time. Just one more time!

Why do we have people like Ossama Bin Laden and millions of muslims who stay away from violence, but both practicing the same religion and same scriptures?

Why do we have people like Babu Bajrangi and Maya Kodnani and millions of peace loving Hindus from the same religion?

Okay there are differences in the way they practice it. Each person have a single religion for her/him selves which is a function of the people and knowledge he is exposed to. But let's put that argument aside and look at this.

Our morality is formed across our childhood experiences and people whom we are exposed to. All our learning in a philosophical or spiritual level are seen in the light of this basic 'moral' framework that have been built for us. There are a lot of interesting scientific experiments to read and understand if you can't digest this theory.

So even if Quran asks to kill (which it does), a part of population will just stay away from it, trying to give a hundred thousand reasons or possible explanations why Quran means something else and will simply stay away from the killing. The other part, that has been abused or made subject to propaganda or are seeking vengeance for something they have lost will just follow the advice and go ahead to kill people. 

This is the same for every religion. Even Buddhism is being politicised in Sri Lanka. Buddhism is famed for its scepticism - a religion that is meant to evolve and is open to interpretation. But yet, you will see buddhist monks in Sri Lanks advising you on what is right and what is wrong.

If we have to follow someone to find the meaning of life or derive or philosophies from, there is no point in living this life. We all have that capable minds to find what is right or wrong for us. To hell with scriptures and dogma - we need an open mind. That's all.

Have you seen an atheist going around killing people because they can't recite Einstein's equations on relativity? Me neither. And that's the whole point.
