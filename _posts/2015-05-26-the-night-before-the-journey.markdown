We all are going to die. That means that we are **alive** at this moment. To know its true meaning, we should meet people. People about whom we know nothing, and would never know anything until you travel to their homes.

Hence I travel.

>A Journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.
      -[Laozi](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Laozi)
      

I am going for a journey that is at least two thousand miles long and I can't wait to take the first step. 

My mind is Inarglia. Yes, Inarglia. It is special mixture of anxiety and excitement. And you are a bit stressed and skeptical about the what happens next. You could compare it with your state of mind  when you are expecting a baby with your girl/boyfriend while you are still at high school.

And of course this is no formal definition. I needed a word here, I made it up.

Now coming to the point, I am travelling to [Spiti Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiti_Valley), starting tomorrow. It is going to be beautiful. It is a long journey that would last about a month. 

I am excited about the volume of things that could happen in during this month. My previous experiences has taught me not to expect anything from a journey, even if you have invested a lot into it.

My writings are not going to reflect even a minute fraction of what I will be learning throughout this voyage. I am a terrible writer. 

But it doesn't matter, in fact nothing matters. Man proposes, Entropy disposes.

That is exactly what is taking me to the Inarglia. I will return a changed man. I would be learning a lot. A lot from people whom I have never met before. I will meet some best people purely by chance. I may miss even better people again by the same chance.

It doesn't matter. 

Man proposes, Entropy disposes.

I have my bag packed and the ticket booked. All I should do is to take that step and savour the rhapsody that the Himalayas serve me.

I will keep writing nevertheless. I am not sure if I could update my blog from there. I don't know what I am going to do with the photos that I take. 

I even don't know what I would be doing in Old manali or Spiti. I would probably go to the [Key Monastery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Monastery). I may spend my time at the hotel room reading the stuff that I like. 

I am telling myself not to expect anything. For I know that I lost my tickets that I booked one month ago when some Gujju decided to sit on the railway tracks demanding 5% reservation in the government jobs.

I hope to know more about the people who reside in the villages. Far away from the main stream politics and media blitskreig. I would like to know what goes inside their heads when they choose their underwear. I hope its not another disgusting picture of Akshay Kumar in one piece. [Doing my bit of stereotyping the villagers]

I hope everything goes fine and I return as a changed man. Drop me a word if I should do something for you in the Himalayas. I will try earnestly to fulfil it. 

See you all soon. Bye.
