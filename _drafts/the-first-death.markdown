title: The first death.

This dream kept coming back to me. I always wanted to censor dreams. Dreams weren't casual affair for me. I lacked that faculty that lets you forget the dreams.

For me, dreams meant permanence. They simply refused to leave my head. The dreams came in with all the colors possible. My nose would twitch - I could feel a myriad of smells coming to me; the sounds were decipherable.

Once I have'seen' my dreams, I had no way of distinguishing them from my memory. My dreams were small protuberances inside my head.
