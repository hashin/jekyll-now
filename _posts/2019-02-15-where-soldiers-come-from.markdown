Passionate warcries to cover up a brother’s death.<br/> 
In his blood do I see the face of enemy.<br/>
But in his face, I see myself - my failure.

He was not a soldier, an intellectual that he was.<br/>
He read, he debated.<br/>
The entire campus watched him speak.<br/>
Ah, the charisma!<br/>
The erudite scrutiny of a flawed national budget.<br/>
His concern for the wretched slumdog.<br/>
Of women raped in broad daylight.

Do you know where soldiers come from?<br/>
A mother’s womb; A father’s care.

When I resigned to my books, I saw him drinking under the peepal tree.<br/>
While I wrote in the mornings, I saw him take his audiobook to marathon.<br/>
I tried to theorize the underpinnings of a fractured society;<br/>
He would walk in the streets, comforting the remnants of a communal flare up.

Do you know why top B-schools hire soldiers?<br/>
Because they are humans. And in their humanity, they see viscerally.<br/>
With every pulse, he felt the pangs of a groaning nation.<br/>
His service was no charity. His decisions rational.
He chose this path, he held no fetish to die.

He didn’t run towards the enemy under neurotic convulsion.<br/>
Your cheap thrill military flicks insult his intellect, but you’re okay with it.

Do you know where soldiers come from?<br/>
A mother’s womb; A father’s care.

He despised the weaponization of education.<br/>
Of handing down hierarchies right from school.<br/>
The best for science and humanities collecting the leftovers?<br/>
Education as a process of pure joy, not of spooky warlike exams.<br/>
Oh, how he mocked the myopic exam warriors,<br/>
-manufactured under the patriotic label of shallow, instant educators!

A soldier with an acute sense of social justice.<br/>
Not of pathological hatred giving away twitter rants.<br/>
Do you even know him when you are vowing to avenge him?

You can’t avenge him, because he was a human who understood war.<br/>
If you don’t go into it, how do you reform it? He asked me the night we parted.<br/>
I had no answer, my endless writings take years to effect,<br/>
While he put Kashmiri kids in school and restored dignity of their mothers.<br/>
Guess, he was more effective. But he’s no more.<br/>
Killed by the sheer apathy of a snowy night that covers victims and killers alike.


He protested haughty officers who tied boys to military jeeps.<br/>
He sent food to hungry artisans at the height of chilly winters.<br/>
Tongue, but not the butt of bayonet that my brother used to talk.<br/>
Military truck carrying apple carts for farmers in distress.<br/>
He was building this nation too - without tirades and tridents.

Angry kids used by someone to man IED laden trucks.<br/>
Trucks that run through highways under big brother's gaze.<br/>
Still the bus was obliterated, his limbs strewn around.<br/>
But my brother is much more than a piece of meat;<br/>
For which you may create more mangled limbs across the border.<br/>
But it is to his soul that you have failed. To his glowing intellect.<br/>
To his desire to serve and better the lives of his brethren.

If there is some heaven out there, he’d be chuckling at your ineptitude.<br/>
This petty minds of yours where he’s an inane killer,<br/>
A lamb, always at haste to sacrifice himself at a moment’s notice.<br/>
No, a soldier is much more than that.<br/>
And you’ll perhaps never understand.

I teach algebra to his kids.<br/>
I recite wordsworth while putting them to sleep;<br/>
I make them read Proust.<br/>
I invoke the wisdom of Nehru;<br/>
Sagacity of Gandhi; the spirit of an intrepid Subhas.<br/>
I sing Khusru to placate them.<br/>
Preach Asoka to mollify their fights;<br/>
Of Akbar to see the god.<br/> 
Of Mohan Roy to approach the books.<br/>
All the giants on whose shoulders their father stood.<br/>
And that father who didn’t fire pellet guns from that pulpit.

Yes, a soldier is dead.<br/>
But you will never know him enough to avenge him.<br/>
And please, don’t drag him down to your intellect so callow.

And I should ask once more!

Do you know where soldiers come from?<br/>
A Mother’s womb; A father’s care.<br/>
Do you know where they go when they die?<br/>
Neurotic glass cages in your petty minds.<br/>
And that is the real tragedy.
