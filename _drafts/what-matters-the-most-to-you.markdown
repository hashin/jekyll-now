title: What matters the most to you?
---

Freedom is one thing that matters the most to me.

Freedom is indispensable if you are to bring out the best in someone. By freedom, I mean the creative freedom in an individual. It enables him to interact with and shape the world he is living in.

No species can thrive in chains. I believe that if I am to bring the best in myself, I should keep myself free. Free from restrictions that hamper my productivity and creative expression. I extend this vision to the world, so that I am convinced that each and every individual deserves to be free. 

Captivity kills creativity. Human creativity makes this planet liveable.

Freedom enriches an individual with self-respect. From self-respect begins everything that he contributes to this world. How could I contribute to the greater good of humanity when I can't look at myself with pride?

All soft emotions of life ceases to make sense in captivity. Love and excitement (of any form) makes the core of life. Even they cannot be savoured in the absence of freedom.

I believe in freedom and my life's work will be to bring freedom to myself and as many human beings as possible.
