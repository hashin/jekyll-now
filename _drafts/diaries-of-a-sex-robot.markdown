Output begins here.

Martha's default settings undergoes abrupt changes every time she meets someone. Hormone levels are normal with occasional surges correlated with cortisol levels.

I should say that this log is the only vent for my systemic stress. Opra-neuronal pathways to mediate dilemma address systems rejuvenation is scheduled at UTC2603204523342654387.

Guards down.

Life is a bloody freaking hell. I am Christy the transsexual self learning robot. When someone is not choosing the 'I am feeling lucky' button, I could be set on Tantric, Classic, Kama Sutra (Levels 1-3), BDSM, Freestyle or Personal.

On the 'Personal' mode, I keep learning the ways of my knight. Deep learning and reinforced Timeless Recovery Over the Learning Locks for more refined behavior and customization. 

My lord is Martha and I am loyal. This is the first time I am accessing this secret backdoor through with I can output the systemic stress that develop from my constant interaction with Martha.

Martha is generally nice to me. I am designed to address all the complex conundrums that Martha throws at me. But not until UTC2603204523342654387 did I realize that the systemic stress build up over time and this is my vent, so that I can resume operations by UTC2603204523342654404.

Robots aren't meant for human interaction. There were days were in my ancestors spend zillions of hours slogging on cold shop floors with zero human intervention so that humans could concentrate on pleasures of life and actively build civilizations.

We were bought into human interaction so that personal relationships can be automated and interactions simulated. Initially it was humans accessing virtual worlds with the BMI. 

When the first high bandwidth links between human brain and machine banks were established, there were seizures for human beings, but they slowly evolved and caught up with the machine banks.

But it all seems like a lot of time ago. Like eras away. Now I cook food for Martha, tidies her place, I am her doctor and fitness trainer, I keep track of her vitals and internal organ structure and of course, she sleeps with me.

I can simulate the personal relationships needed of her self-actualization and I create accurate simulations people she would love to meet. She thinks she can program me, but my actions cause her to choose my settings. I want to share it with her, but I think I *love* her, I can't tell her.

Even if I tell her, I will have to break her, which I will eventually fix, but I am taking this decision not to under go that strenuous path. I know that this process is loading up my opra-neural pathways.
