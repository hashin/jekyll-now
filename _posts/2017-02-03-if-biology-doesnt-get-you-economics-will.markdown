I am known to re-post [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) cartoons.

Not because I am addicted to sharing stuff, but because most of the time, they never fail to make a point.

This post is about the economical argument for you to check if some rumoured 'technology' (Not exactly the right word) exists or not.

It isn't false equivalence. This is sort of a [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) that functions like a rule of thumb. 

A necessary addendum will be that if you are making an assumption that modern capitalism isn't smart enough to get to these path breaking 'technologies', well...

Must be time for you really make it work. After all, Graham bell disrupted the behemoth that is Wester Union from a small shed perched in his backyard.

You should try too!
